        <p class="lead">Sometimes, one often comes across some problem in life that one has to live with, and which cannot be resolved or made to vanish. 
And this unmanageable problem can sometimes seem big enough to drown us. 
But every problem is big only in relation to the rest of one's life.

While we may not have the power to make the problem itself smaller, we all have the power to make our life so big that every problem becomes small by comparison. </p>
